## Features

- **Validate**: Check the syntax and structure of kubeconfig files for common errors or inconsistencies.
- **Convert**: Convert between different formats (YAML to JSON or JSON to YAML).
- **Merge**: Combine multiple kubeconfig files into a single file, preserving context and cluster information, and avoiding duplication.
